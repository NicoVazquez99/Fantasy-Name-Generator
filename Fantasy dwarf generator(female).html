<p>Short, stout, bearded and fond of singing, drinking, mining and fighting. Dwarves — or "dwarfs" — are another group often portrayed as ancient and much more advanced than humanity, but diminishing and declining. Dwarves usually live in immense, richly decorated mountain holds, and are often master craftsmen and smiths. If any one race is making use of machinery and industry at a more than medieval level, it'll often be the dwarves. They don't get along with elves and like orcs even less, but tend to be on decent terms with humanity.</p>

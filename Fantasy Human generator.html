<h2>What is an Human?</h2>
<p>Humans are typically a much younger race than the others (generally meaning that they haven't been civilized as long) and are not typically taken very seriously by older factions. They're also often the most mundane group, being a lot less adept at magic, attuned to the environment, or otherwise "mystical" than others. They're the most likely species to be divided into multiple nations, which will likely be based on various historical civilizations, and tend to be more widespread than other races. These nations often don't get along well with one another; out of all races, humans are the ones most likely to be on both the side of Good and Evil. Humans are often perceived as uncouth and primitive by other civilized factions — in fact, it's far from rare for other groups to perceive humanity as only marginally more tolerable than the barbarian races. Human Subspecies may exist to further show how adaptive they are, and usually have their own defining traits.</p>

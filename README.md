# Practice_Fantasy
"Fantasy" is the name of this project, is a a random name generator for rpg games or whatever you need it for. You have four races to choose: Humans, Elves, Dwarfs and Dragons.
Each race comes with variations for male and female except for the dragons, those are unisex.
You can see the names list inside of the Javascript files, i took them from books, movies and other popular media.
The project was made in English but has French and German translation, i made the translations with DeepL some sentences could be wrong.

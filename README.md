# Practice_Fantasy
"Fantasy" is the name of this project, is a a random name generator for rpg games or whatever you need it for. You have four races to choose: Humans, Elves, Dwarfs and Dragons.
Each race comes with names for male and female exectp for the dragons, those names are unisex.
You can see the names list inside of the Javascript files, i took them from books, movies and other popular media.
The project was made in English but has French and German translation, i made the translations with DeepL some sentences could be wrong.

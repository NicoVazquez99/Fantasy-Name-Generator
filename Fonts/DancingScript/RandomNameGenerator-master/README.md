This is a program to generate random fantasy/sci-fi names. To do so, you must first parse an input file.

For an example of an input file, you can go check /media/greek_myth_sample. Your file must start and end with a space and all names must be space-delimited. 

A simple script, fix_sample.rb, is provided which will attempt to fix a sample file to convert it to a format more in line with what is expected by this program.

See the file random_name_generator_test.rb for an example of using the program to generate a group of random names.

Usage 
=====

Run and have a look at random_name_generator_test.rb for how to use the program.

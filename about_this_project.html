<h1>About this Project</h1>
<h2>This is  my first programing project it was made entenry using html, Javascript and CSS. I made it this way because i wanted to test my skills in those lenguajes.<br>The whole project took me about 4 monts to finish and in this time i had made about 4 or 5 versions of this page but this is the best i could do.</h2>
<p>How this works?<br> Go to the main page (use the go back button in the side menu)you have to select race and a gender -dragons does not have gender selection- </p>
<p spellcheck="true"> Features:
<ul>
    <li>Five different races to choose.</li>
    <li>Names are generated randomly.</li>
    <li>Names and images can be easily related to famous characters from videogames,movies and books of the fantasy genre.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Future Updates:
<ul>
    <li>Neutral name options for each race.</li>
    <li>More races are in the way!...for example: Dark elves, Dhampirs, Ents, half elves and even more.</li>
    <li>Suggestions: i would like to make a "suggerences" window, a place were you can send Suggestions like races, names or ideas about the website.</li>
    <li>Fixing the animations an some randomizer problems.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><u>I do not owe none of the images or characters showed or mentioned in this whole website as i mentioned before those come from movies, books, games or tv shows.</u></p>
